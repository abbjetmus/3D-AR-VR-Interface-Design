## Scene view and Game view
In the center of the default Unity Editor layout is the **Scene view**. This is your interactive window into the world you are creating. You’ll use the Scene view to manipulate objects and view them from various angles.<br><br>
In the default layout, the **Game view** also appears in this area; you’ll use the Game view to playtest your game.

## Hierarchy window
The **Hierarchy** is where you can organize all the things in your game world (and the world itself). These things are called **GameObjects**.<br><br>
If you add a GameObject to your project in Scene view, it will be listed in the Hierarchy. If you delete a GameObject from the Scene, it will no longer be listed.
